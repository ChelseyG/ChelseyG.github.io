Policy Ignite is an event for public servants where people come together to promote innovative ideas in policy development. The event featured about ten speakers from various areas who pitched ideas on how technology could be applied (mostly in the government sphere) to improve current processes and services for the public. The speakers discussed tools that could be used, like github and slack, to promote collaboration and sharing of ideas.

Isaac Caverhiil-Godkewitch’s speech stood out to me because he discussed the ways we can improve Digital Mental Health tools to make them more accessible, have friendly indexes, and provide services at a touch instead of having to search through a website. The application that is available on your phone, would contain all the same information as the government’s official mental health site, but would provide direct results for your specific need with only one click. This tool stands out for me, because, upon seeing the websites for information on mental health, they are convoluted and complicated. People in need of assistance do not have time to search through pages and pages of information. The application would provide the assistance needed in one touch to those who need assistance and those who are looking for assistance for someone else.

Another speaker that really interested me, whose name escapes me, discussed the challenges of digitization due to the fallibility of humans. Her talk mentioned that we need to consider the impacts of human error as well as subjectivity and bias when we digitize. Most people promote digitization without considering the limitations due to human intervention. Humans are not perfect, therefore, can we really be reassured that our technology is perfect? While the speaker was still promoting digitization, she wants us to consider every aspect of it in order to produce the best possible product.
