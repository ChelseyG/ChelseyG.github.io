title: Who am I
---
I am a Carleton University masterâ€™s student looking to explore the world of Digital Humanities. I look to understand and explore the field along with what it has to offer. The purpose of this digital notebook, which is what I will be calling this blog, is to trace my experience with DH on a variety of topics while investigating the different technology and tools available. Each post will cover a different topic that is being/has been transformed by digitalization. 

My digital notebook is part of a project for a course I am taking at Carleton University.
