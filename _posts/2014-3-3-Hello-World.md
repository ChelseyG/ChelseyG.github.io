title: What is Code?
---

“What is code” seems like a fairly simple question to ask, but it is not. Determining a definition is a complex exploit because it brings to light much more intricate questions. When we really start to look at the question, we start asking ourselves questions of the questions. So, what exactly do we mean by code? Well, I would define code as a series of ideas or phrases that form a cipher. The problem is that I am thinking of code in a non-technical sense, which makes the definition far too generic. So my next question would be what is technical code? The question is still generic enough to support a variety of ideas, but specific enough to direct our though in one direction, which is what the question did when we were asked this in class. Instead of a fixed definition, we came up with a hierarchical structure to explain “code”. Therefore, we described code as a system made up of languages that provide instructions to create an output within a framework. So what does that mean? Well, the English major would compare coding to writing for example a novel. So the language would be the incoherent individual standalone sentences and/or words. Instructions are the product of the language becoming coherent; words form sentences, which form paragraphs, which form chapters. The output itself is the novel, while the framework is the structure, the way the instructions are laid out to differentiate a novel from a short story.  

## Code and the Humanities 
The problem with code is that it is not accessible to everyone. Technological advancements have shaped the way we interact and learn, for instance, coding has become part of the curriculum for some elementary schools, but what about under funder schools? What happens to people who grow up in areas that have not experienced such vast technological advancements? The problem with the digital word is people are left out of the narrative, especially if they do not have money. Technology has become such a necessary piece of everyday life. Large companies are concerned with improving or creating the newest technology in order to compete with other large companies. It seems code now functions as a way to make money and for those beneficial enough to be part of the narrative, code has fundamentally changed the way we live. Think of all the things you can do on your phone. Now think of the only thing we used to be able to do with phones. With the availability of technology comes dependency as well and it’s this dependency large companies feed off to make profit on their code.  

## What you need to know about coding:
1.	Make mistakes
  * What I have come to learn is that the more mistakes you make the more you learn. The time spent understanding where there are errors in the code is time spent understanding how code works. It’s as [Paul Ford](https://hyp.is/g2Qrcq-bEeeNevsDW2jk8A/www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) said, “software taught me about software”. Failure is inevitable, but it is necessary for success.
  
2.	Take breaks
  *	When you encounter problems without any known solution, the best thing you can do is come back a few hours or days later and review your work with a fresh mind. Taking breaks allows you to reflect on what you have accomplished and what you have failed to do. You will find it much easier to find solutions to the mistakes you have made. 
3.	Throw away code
  * Your code will not be perfect on the first try, unless you are some type of coding genius. Be prepared to start over more than once, “plan to throw away; you will, anyhow” ([Eric Steven Raymond](https://hyp.is/Pv8mSq-fEee2Rssvqp-XkQ/www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html)).
  
4)	Use other people’s code
  * Using other people’s code as a starting point and building off of it is the easiest way to build your own code. Do not think you have to accomplish everything on your own. Learning from others is the easiest way to wrap your head around what you are doing.
