## Definition
🚧I have come across many definitions for accessibility, but I do feel that George H. Williams best defines it in his article [“Access”](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/access/) in the *Digital Pedagogy for the Humanities* journal. Williams writes, “[a]ccessibility exists when a user . . . can easily make use of a particular digital resource . . . with their choice of technology . . . and can, as a result, cognitively process the information as it comes to them from that resource through that technology”. 

The key terms in this definition that I feel best reflect the term ‘accessibility,’ in a digital context, are “easy”, “choice”, “cognitively process”, “through technology”. 

Information should always be easily available and accessible otherwise it defeats the purpose of making something accessible. Further, users should be able to choose what best suits their needs. Someone who suffers from colorblindness may require different requirements than someone who has dyslexia. Cognitive process is the ability to take the transformed information and make sense of it, which is accomplished through technology. 🚧
