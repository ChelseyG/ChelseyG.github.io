## Magical Methods: Using Topic Models in Digital Humanities' Research
### November 22, 2017
Professor Shawn Graham of Carleton University spoke about topic modeling in the field of digital humanities with a focus on archeology. First, he explained that a (large) part of digital humanities is borrowing from other disciplines and applying it to our own field of study. 

The current problems, Professor Graham highlights regarding topic modeling, are whether the data is scarce or abundant, material shifting across formats, and the problem of big data. Big data can be both a blessing and/or a problem. Big data can come in many forms like 200 electronic documents (blessing) or 200 years’ worth of archeological artifacts (problem). What we need to keep in mind when using big data to topic model is that it does not provide a justification, but rather another way to understand the data in front of us. I think this statement is the most important statement that Professor Graham made during his lecture on the subject.   

He then goes on to discuss that often, visualizing the data pulled from topic models is a good way to see all the data at once and to compare and contrast the results to come up with an understanding. He displayed several examples of the ways visualization can be applied to topic modeling. He also mentioned the importance of using other people code as a starting point for your own. There is no need to start from scratch, but there is opportunity to learn from others. 

## FWD 50: Realizing the potential of our digital future / Réaliser le potentiel de notre futur numérique
### November 2, 2017
Nancy Chahwan, Deputy Commissioner of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) spoke on Thursday November 2 about the ways the CRA has been implementing digitization to foster innovation and improve services for the public, as part of FWD 50, which is Canada's digital government conference. She touched on:

* The tools the agency is using for service modernization
*	The ways that digitizing processes has actually improved service turnaround time from 6 weeks to 24 hour
*	The implementation of agile framework into government project development instead of waterfall
*	The visions for programs and client services that the agency hopes to digitize in the future
*	The ways they hope to improve current processes like cyber security

Nancy’s talk, though not long, discusses the way the government “no longer just encourages innovation, [but is] expecting it”.

## Policy Ignite! Presents: Canada in the Digital World/Canada dans la monde numérique 
### November 2, 2017
Policy Ignite is an event for public servants where people come together to promote innovative ideas in policy development. The event featured about ten speakers from various areas who pitched ideas on how technology could be applied (mostly in the government sphere) to improve current processes and services for the public. The speakers discussed tools that could be used, like github and slack, to promote collaboration and sharing of ideas. 

Isaac Caverhiil-Godkewitch’s speech stood out to me because he discussed the ways we can improve Digital Mental Health tools to make them more accessible, have friendly indexes, and provide services at a touch instead of having to search through a website. The application that is available on your phone, would contain all the same information as the government’s official mental health site, but would provide direct results for your specific need with only one click. This tool stands out for me, because, upon seeing the websites for information on mental health, they are convoluted and complicated. People in need of assistance do not have time to search through pages and pages of information. The application would provide the assistance needed in one touch to those who need assistance and those who are looking for assistance for someone else. 

Another speaker that really interested me, whose name escapes me, discussed the challenges of digitization due to the fallibility of humans. Her talk mentioned that we need to consider the impacts of human error as well as subjectivity and bias when we digitize. Most people promote digitization without considering the limitations due to human intervention. Humans are not perfect, therefore, can we really be reassured that our technology is perfect? While the speaker was still promoting digitization, she wants us to consider every aspect of it in order to produce the best possible product.
