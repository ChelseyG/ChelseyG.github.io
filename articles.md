This page contains articles and tools consulted for each of the topic explored in my digital notebook. 

## Mapping
#### Articles:
[Fred Gibbs - Digital Mapping + Geospatial Humanities](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/digital-mapping/)

[Stuart Eve - The Embodied GIS: Using Reality to explore multi-sensory archaeological landscapes](http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue44/3/index.html)

[Diana D. Sinton - Mapping](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/mapping/)

[Johanna Drucker - Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html)

#### Tools:

[OpenStreet](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=2/71.3/-96.8) is a community driven mapping site where local uses can contribute and maintain maps. The website is entirely user generated and provides different details (like where garbage and recylcing is located) that you cannot find on Google Maps. 

[Google Maps](https://www.google.ca/maps) is a mapping site that shows you how to get from A to B. The map allows you to dive into the maps and "walk around". 

[Map Warper](mapwarper.net) is a really neat site that allows you to overlap two maps of the same area from different time periods to see how certain characteristics have changed over time. 

## Accessibility
#### Articles:
[Eleanor Ratliff - Accessibility Whack-A-Mole](https://alistapart.com/article/accessibility-whack-a-mole)

[BookwormBlues - I Am Not Broken: The Language of Disability](http://www.bookwormblues.net/2014/09/10/i-am-not-broken-the-language-of-disability/)

[George H. Williams - Access](https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/keywords/access/)

####Tools:

[Funkify](http://funkify.org/)is a disability stimulator that allows users to experience what it is like using computers with a particular disability. It must be noted that this tool, while neat, is not an accurate representation of each disability it simulates. It is also important to note that this tool represents real struggles for real people and shouldn't be treated like a toy. This means saying things like "this is so cool" can be offensive for those who have a disability and struggle everyday with exactly what the tool simulates.

#### Tools
[Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/)
  is a great tool for annotating web articles and keeping track of your annotations. I use hypothesis to annotate all the articles I explore for this course.

[Github](http://github.com)
  is the tool I use to keep track of my notes and to familiarize myself with coding. Github was also used for the creation of this blog. 

[Prose](prose.io)
  is a content editor tool. It is more user friendly for those who are not as familiar with coding and can be linked directly to your github account. Updates made in prose will automatically commit to your github account.
