[Word Cloud](https://www.wordclouds.com/) will use data provide to form an image made up of words where the large words are those used the most in the dataset and the smaller words are those used less in the dataset.

#### Tools
[Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/)
  is a great tool for annotating web articles and keeping track of your annotations. I use hypothesis to annotate all the articles I explore for this course.

[Github](http://github.com)
  is the tool I use to keep track of my notes and to familiarize myself with coding. Github was also used for the creation of this blog. 

[Prose](prose.io)
  is a content editor tool. It is more user friendly for those who are not as familiar with coding and can be linked directly to your github account. Updates made in prose will automatically commit to your github account.
